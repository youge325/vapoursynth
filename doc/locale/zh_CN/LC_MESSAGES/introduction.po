"VapourSynth is an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or a "
"library. It's hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++ and "
"a Python module to allow video scripts to be created. It came to be when I "
"started thinking about alternative designs for Avisynth and most of it was "
"written over a 3 month period."

"VapourSynth 是一个视频处理应用程序，也可以是一个插件，或者一个库。由于它既有用 C++ 编写的核心库，又有用于创建视频脚本的 Python "
"模块，所以很难精确定义它。它诞生于我开始思考 Avisynth 替代设计方案之时，大部分代码在 3 个月内完成。"

"The software has been heavily inspired by `Avisynth "
"<http://www.avisynth.nl>`_ and aims to be a 21st century rewrite, taking "
"advantage of the advancements computers have made since the late 90s. The "

"Fredrik Mellbin majored in electrical engineering with a focus on image "
"analysis and processing with medical applications. He has previously worked "
"with digital electronics and likes to plan his own software projects in his "
"spare time. When he one day found himself out of work he needed something to"
" do between sending out job applications and waiting for a reply. The "
"natural choice for the author was to try to improve Avisynth, the software "
"that once made him interested in video editing. VapourSynth is the result of"
" all that time waiting."
