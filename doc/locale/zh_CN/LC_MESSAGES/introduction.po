"VapourSynth is an application for video manipulation. Or a plugin. Or a "
"library. It's hard to tell because it has a core library written in C++ "
"and a Python module to allow video scripts to be created. It came to be "
"when I started thinking about alternative designs for Avisynth and most "
"of it was written over a 3 month period."

"VapourSynth 是一个用于视频处理的应用程序。或者说是一个插件。或者是一个库。"
"很难说清楚，因为它有一个用 C++ 编写的核心库和一个 Python 模块，允许创建视频脚本。"
"当我开始思考 Avisynth 的替代设计时，它就诞生了，大部分代码是在 3 个月内完成的。"

"Fredrik Mellbin majored in electrical engineering with a focus on image "
"analysis and processing with medical applications. He has previously "
"worked with digital electronics and likes to plan his own software "
"projects in his spare time. When he one day found himself out of work he "
"needed something to do between sending out job applications and waiting "
"for a reply. The natural choice for the author was to try to improve "
"Avisynth, the software that once made him interested in video editing. "
"VapourSynth is the result of all that time waiting."

"之间做点什么。对作者来说，自然的选择就是尝试改进 Avisynth —— 这个曾经让他对视频编辑"
"产生兴趣的软件。VapourSynth 就是所有那些等待时间的结果。"
